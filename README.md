# Comercial Casa Blanca Website
Hi there! This is the repo for my grandmother's furniture store website! 

## Description
After traveling to El Salvador the summer of 2022, I noticed my grandmother's furniture store did not
have a website. As a result, I decided to make a landing page for her store and include some product displays,
contact information, and a business story.

## Tools Used
The most important tools I used included using Django's sqlite database to store pictures of products and sort them by category within the database. Then, in my views.py file, I would get all of the database objects for a certain product category and send them to the html template so that django would automatically produce the code for each product. Being able to do this saved me so much time since I did not have to statically code the div for each product. Django would just do that for me. Another important tool I used that impacted the user experience was learning how to use JavaScript's intersection observer. This allowed me to make the images slide in responsively on the story section and deliver a more interactive experience.
